## Project Task3: Interrupts
Project task: explain *interrupts* as used in the MC1322x.

my brainstorm questions
- **what** are interrupts
- **why** interrupts?
- **how** to use interrupts?

[C Library for the MC1322x](https://github.com/malvira/libmc1322x)
- check the wiki
- code of interest: `tests/tmr-ints.c`
	- tmr = timer
	- ints = interrupts
	- the "investigation" question: how are timers and interrupts used for blinking the LED?

# Sidenotes
"Don't just be a *passive passenger* in learning"
- be the driver, not always the one being driven/guided around
