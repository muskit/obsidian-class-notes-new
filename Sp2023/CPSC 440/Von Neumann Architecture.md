CPU
- registers
- ALU
- runs in a Von Neumann cycle
	a. Fetch
	b. Decode (translate from binary to instruction/actions) 
	c. Execute

Memory
- ROM: non-volatile read-only
	- technically not read-only; program gets burned at first
- RAM: volatile read-write
	- leaves out the "reading" aspect
- "Flash": non-volatile read-write

I/O
- networking
- peripherals
