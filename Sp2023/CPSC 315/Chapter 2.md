We look at two kinds of ethical theories 

## non-workable ethical theories
These can't apply to all people; might be controversial
1. subjective relativism 
    - relativism: what we think of as "right" is relative to some other baseline. has no universal norms for right or wrong 
    - subjective makes it a selfish view: one thinks that only they are right 
2. cultural relativism 
    - relativism with the baseline being localized to a (community) culture's perspective 
3. divine command theory 
    - God's will; rules of a religion 
4.  ethical egoism 
    - one thinks they're doing the right thing and expects others to do the same 
    - like subjective egoism, except it benefits purely them in the long-term 

## (workable) ethical theories
1. Kantianism 
    - emphasizes good will 
    - consists of some rules ("formulations"): 
        1. Act only in moral rules: your will or the results of the act should also be accepted in moral law (accepted by everybody).  
        2. Don't use others purely as a means to an end. 
            
2. Utilitarianism (knowing that actions ---> consequences)
    - balance your consequences: benefits > harm 
    - advantages > disadvantages 
    - adopt moral rules to the balancing 
    - Utility to Rules 
        - Implies that if followed by everyone, leads to best increase in happiness 
    - Act Utilitarianism 
        - A more "raw" comparison; do pros outweigh the cons? 
3. social contract theory 
    - government-imposed laws 
    - dictated entirely by writing 
4. virtue ethics 
    - following a virtuous person 
    - one expects that person to always be correct in issues
